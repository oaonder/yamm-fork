# Yet Another Mail Merge Fork #

**This in an unoffical copy of the old YAMM code. It is not maintained and will no longer work in the new Google Sheets**

Due to the Script gallery not being available in the new Google Sheets, and the
Yet Another Mail Merge addon now wanting money due to "ongoing development" costs
for a script that was perfectly fine, I've got the last version of the YAMM code
from the scripts gallery. It was a simple script then, and so it will remain a
simple script now. Let the community develop new features if they want, and fix
the bugs they find.

I've made small modifications to allow us to use it in the new Sheets,
including the initial conversion to an Addon instead of a "Script" (just a new
menu location). I also made it not run a merge if all the "Merge Fields" in the
email aren't present in the spreadsheet.

 * To use, open the Script Editor from the spreadsheet you wish to use
 * Copy and paste each file into the script editor.
 * From the Run menu, select "onInstall"
